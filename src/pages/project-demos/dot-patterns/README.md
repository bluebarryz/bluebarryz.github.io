## Dot Patterns
<a href="https://bluebarryz.github.io/#/dot-patterns">bluebarryz.github.io/#/dot-patterns</a>
<p>An animated game for creating beautiful patterns by rotating an array of dots on the screen. Runs on
desktop and mobile devices.</p>

## How it works
<p>The game is simple, but there are many possible patterns you can create. It starts off with a bunch of dots on the screen, arranged in either a grid/lattice or randomly scattered. Click 'Play Next' to rotate these dots by a certain angle (which you can set in the 'Controls' menu). There is also a control called 'Radius Scaler' which determines whether you want the dots to be rotated in a perfect circle (which would be a 1x radius scaler, i.e. the radius doesn't change), rotated outwards in a spiral (radius scaler > 1x), or inwards in a spiral (radius scaler < 1). Each time you click 'Play Next', the dots rotate again, and you can click 'Reset' to start over.</p>

</p>You can create some very interesting patterns with just these simple, small rotations!</p>
